This is an archive for as many old/OG/just generally hard to find cracking tools that are out there on the internet, scraped from multiple sources, like the now defunct cracked.io and nulled.to forums, Telegram, and occasionally upload.ee links dorked from google
If you decide to run these, IT IS AS YOUR OWN RISK! It is common that these tools will be detected by most antiviruses as they are hacking tools, and ancient ones at that, so if you don't trust, don't run them. Period.

I AM NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT ANYONE DECIDES TO DO WITH THIS ARCHIVE! THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND ARCHIVING PURPOSES ONLY! I WANT TO KEEP THE PAST ALIVE :))
